# SQL Course Notes

## 1. Creating and Managing Databases

### Creating a Database
```sql
-- Basic syntax
CREATE DATABASE database_name;

-- Example
CREATE DATABASE school_management;

-- Create database if it doesn't exist
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS school_management;
```

### Using a Database
```sql
-- Switch to a database
USE school_management;

-- Show all databases
SHOW DATABASES;

-- Delete a database (be careful!)
DROP DATABASE database_name;
```

## 2. Creating Tables

### Basic Table Creation Syntax
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype1 constraints,
    column2 datatype2 constraints,
    column3 datatype3 constraints,
    ...
);
```

### Example 1: Creating a Simple Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    date_of_birth DATE
);
```

### Common Data Types
- INT / INTEGER: Whole numbers
- VARCHAR(n): Variable-length text with maximum length n
- TEXT: Variable unlimited-length text
- DATE: Date values
- DECIMAL(p,s): Decimal numbers with p total digits and s decimal places
- BOOLEAN: True/False values

### Common Constraints
- PRIMARY KEY: Unique identifier for the row
- NOT NULL: Column cannot contain NULL value
- UNIQUE: All values in column must be unique
- DEFAULT value: Sets a default value for the column
- FOREIGN KEY: Creates a link between tables

### Practice Exercises

1. Create a Database and Table:
```sql
-- First, create a bookstore database
CREATE DATABASE bookstore;

-- Switch to the bookstore database
USE bookstore;

-- Then create a books table
CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    publication_date DATE,
    isbn VARCHAR(13) UNIQUE,
    price DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```

2. Check Your Work:
```sql
-- Show all tables in the current database
SHOW TABLES;

-- Show the structure of your table
DESCRIBE books;
```

## 3. SQL SHOW Commands

### Basic SHOW Commands
```sql
-- List all databases on the server
SHOW DATABASES;

-- List all tables in the current database
SHOW TABLES;

-- List all tables in a specific database
SHOW TABLES FROM database_name;

-- Show all columns in a table
SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name;
-- OR use this alternative
DESCRIBE table_name;

-- Show create statement for a table
SHOW CREATE TABLE table_name;

-- Show table status (includes info about table size, rows, etc.)
SHOW TABLE STATUS;

-- Show all users and their hosts
SHOW USERS;

-- Show all active processes
SHOW PROCESSLIST;

-- Show all available character sets
SHOW CHARACTER SET;

-- Show all available collations
SHOW COLLATION;

-- Show server status variables
SHOW STATUS;

-- Show server system variables
SHOW VARIABLES;

-- Show grants for current user
SHOW GRANTS;
```

### Examples of Using SHOW Commands

```sql
-- Example 1: Create a database and inspect it
CREATE DATABASE bookstore;
SHOW DATABASES;

-- Example 2: Create a table and inspect its structure
CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(200)
);
SHOW TABLES;
DESCRIBE books;

-- Example 3: Show detailed table information
SHOW CREATE TABLE books;

-- Example 4: Show tables with a specific pattern
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'book%';

-- Example 5: Show column information with specific pattern
SHOW COLUMNS FROM books LIKE '%id';
```

### Tips for Using SHOW Commands
- Use SHOW commands for database administration and debugging
- Combine with LIKE for pattern matching
- DESCRIBE is a shorthand for SHOW COLUMNS FROM
- Most SHOW commands can be combined with WHERE clauses
- Use these commands to verify your database structure

## 4. SQL DESCRIBE Commands

### Basic DESCRIBE Syntax
```sql
-- Basic syntax
DESCRIBE table_name;
-- OR
DESC table_name;
-- OR (full form)
SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name;
```

### Understanding DESCRIBE Output
When you run DESCRIBE, you get these columns:
- Field: Column name
- Type: Data type of the column
- Null: Whether NULL values are allowed (YES or NO)
- Key: Type of key (PRI for primary, UNI for unique, MUL for multiple occurrences)
- Default: Default value for the column
- Extra: Additional information (auto_increment, etc.)

### Examples of DESCRIBE Usage

```sql
-- Example 1: Create and describe a simple table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    hire_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

DESCRIBE employees;
/* Output will look like:
Field      | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra
-----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------
emp_id     | INT         | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment
first_name | VARCHAR(50) | NO   |     | NULL    |
last_name  | VARCHAR(50) | NO   |     | NULL    |
hire_date  | DATE        | YES  |     | CURRENT_DATE |
salary     | DECIMAL(10,2)| YES |     | NULL    |
*/

-- Example 2: Describe specific column
DESCRIBE employees emp_id;

-- Example 3: Using DESCRIBE with wildcards
DESCRIBE employees '%name';  -- Shows all columns ending with 'name'

-- Example 4: Describe table from specific database
DESCRIBE database_name.table_name;
```

### Variations and Related Commands
```sql
-- Get detailed table creation statement
SHOW CREATE TABLE employees;

-- Get full table information
SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM employees;

-- Get basic table status
SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'employees';

-- Get index information
SHOW INDEX FROM employees;
```

### Common Use Cases
1. **Schema Verification**:
```sql
-- Check if table exists and its structure
DESCRIBE employees;
```

2. **Column Information**:
```sql
-- Find specific column details
DESCRIBE employees salary;
```

3. **Key Detection**:
```sql
-- Check which columns are keys
DESCRIBE employees;
-- Look for 'PRI', 'UNI', or 'MUL' in Key column
```

### Tips for Using DESCRIBE
- Use DESCRIBE before modifying tables to verify structure
- Combine with SHOW CREATE TABLE for complete table definition
- Use wildcards to filter specific columns
- Remember DESC is a shorthand for DESCRIBE
- Use SHOW FULL COLUMNS when you need additional column information like comments and collation

Sure! Here's a clear breakdown of **each `INSERT` command** you've listed — **with distinct, complete, and simple examples** for every concept. Each example uses either the `products` or `product_details` table.

---








## ✅ 1. **Basic INSERT Syntax**

### Example: Insert one product with all columns specified

```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, price, stock)
VALUES ('Smartphone', 499.99, 80);
```

---

## ✅ 2. **Multiple Rows INSERT**

### Example: Insert several products in one command

```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, price, stock)
VALUES 
    ('Tablet', 299.99, 60),
    ('Charger', 19.99, 200),
    ('Case', 9.99, 500);
```

---

## ✅ 3. **INSERT with SELECT**

### Example: Copy from `temp_products` into `products`

```sql
-- First: Create and insert into a temp table
CREATE TABLE temp_products (
    name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10,2)
);
INSERT INTO temp_products VALUES ('Speaker', 89.99), ('Camera', 399.99);

-- Then: Insert from temp_products to products
INSERT INTO products (name, price)
SELECT name, price FROM temp_products;
```

---

## ✅ 4. **INSERT IGNORE**

### Example: Avoid error if duplicate primary key

```sql
-- Assume product_id 1 already exists
INSERT IGNORE INTO products (product_id, name, price)
VALUES (1, 'Duplicate Phone', 399.99);  -- This row will be ignored
```

---

## ✅ 5. **INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE**

### Example: Insert or update product if `product_id` already exists

```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, price, stock)
VALUES (1, 'Smartphone Pro', 599.99, 70)
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
    price = VALUES(price),
    stock = VALUES(stock);
```

---

## ✅ 6. **INSERT with Calculated Expressions**

### Example: Use an average price for a bundle product

```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, price, stock)
VALUES ('Accessory Bundle', (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products) * 0.9, 25);
```

---

## ✅ 7. **INSERT with SET Syntax**

### Example: Use SET to insert values instead of VALUES keyword

```sql
INSERT INTO products
SET name = '3D Printer',
    price = 499.99,
    stock = 12;
```

---

## ✅ 8. **INSERT with JSON**

### Example: Insert a product with JSON details

```sql
CREATE TABLE product_details (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    details JSON
);

INSERT INTO product_details (id, details)
VALUES (1, '{"color": "black", "weight": "2.5kg", "features": ["wireless", "bluetooth"]}');
```

---

## ✅ 9. **Best Practice: Always Specify Columns**

### Good:

```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, price, stock)
VALUES ('Microphone', 89.99, 40);
```

### Bad (don’t do this):

```sql
INSERT INTO products
VALUES (NULL, 'Microphone', 89.99, 40, NULL);
```

---

## ✅ 10. **Best Practice: Use Batch Inserts**

### Good (batch insert):

```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, price)
VALUES 
    ('Item A', 10.00),
    ('Item B', 20.00),
    ('Item C', 30.00);
```

### Bad (individual insert):

```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Item A', 10.00);
INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Item B', 20.00);
INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Item C', 30.00);
```

---

## ✅ 11. **Best Practice: Use Transactions**

### Example: Multiple inserts in a transaction block

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO products (name, price)
VALUES ('Webcam Pro', 149.99);

INSERT INTO products (name, price)
VALUES ('Tripod', 39.99);

COMMIT;
```

---

## ✅ 12. **Error Handling: Duplicate Key**

### Solution 1: IGNORE

```sql
INSERT IGNORE INTO products (product_id, name)
VALUES (2, 'Tablet 2024');
```

### Solution 2: ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE

```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_id, name)
VALUES (2, 'Tablet 2024')
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE name = VALUES(name);
```

---

## ✅ 13. **Error Handling: Data Type Mismatch**

### Example: Cast a string to the correct data type

```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, price)
VALUES ('USB Cable', CAST('15.99' AS DECIMAL(10,2)));
```

---
That's great to hear! Since you've learned `INSERT` commands — which are about **adding data** — the natural next step is to learn how to **retrieve and view data**.

---

## 🔜 **Next Recommended Topic: SQL `SELECT` Statements**

### Why?

`SELECT` is the **most important** SQL command. It lets you **query data** from tables in flexible, powerful ways.

---

## 📘 What You’ll Learn in the `SELECT` Topic:

### 1. **Basic SELECT Syntax**

```sql
SELECT * FROM island;
SELECT name, country FROM island;
```

### 2. **Filtering with WHERE**

```sql
SELECT * FROM island WHERE country = 'Indonesia';
```

### 3. **Ordering with ORDER BY**

```sql
SELECT * FROM island ORDER BY area_km2 DESC;
```

### 4. **Limiting Rows**

```sql
SELECT * FROM island LIMIT 5;
```

### 5. **Using Aliases**

```sql
SELECT name AS island_name FROM island;
```

### 6. **Aggregate Functions**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(area_km2) FROM island;
```

### 7. **GROUP BY and HAVING**

```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*) FROM island GROUP BY country;
```

### 8. **Joins (Later sub-topic)**

```sql
SELECT i.name, d.metadata
FROM island i
JOIN island_info d ON i.id = d.island_id;
```

Great! Let's dive into the **`UPDATE` statement**, which is used to **modify existing data** in a SQL table.

---







## 🔧 What Is `UPDATE`?

The `UPDATE` statement allows you to **change values** in one or more columns **for existing rows**.

---

## 🔤 Basic Syntax

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;
```

⚠️ **Always use a `WHERE` clause**, or else **all rows will be updated**.

---

## 🏝️ Let's Use Your `island` Table

Assume your table looks like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM island;

-- id | name       | country      | area_km2 | population
--  1 | Bora Bora  | France       | 30.55    | 10500
--  2 | Bali       | Indonesia    | 5780.00  | 4230050
--  3 | Maui       | USA          | 1883.50  | 144444
```

---

## ✅ 1. **Update One Column**

### 🔹 Example: Change population of Bora Bora

```sql
UPDATE island
SET population = 12000
WHERE name = 'Bora Bora';
```

---

## ✅ 2. **Update Multiple Columns**

### 🔹 Example: Update both area and population

```sql
UPDATE island
SET area_km2 = 32.00, population = 13000
WHERE name = 'Bora Bora';
```

---

## ✅ 3. **Update All Rows (Use with caution!)**

### 🔹 Example: Increase all island populations by 5%

```sql
UPDATE island
SET population = population * 1.05;
```

🚨 This affects every row. Only do this intentionally!

---

## ✅ 4. **Update with a Condition**

### 🔹 Example: Set country to 'USA' where area is above 2000

```sql
UPDATE island
SET country = 'USA'
WHERE area_km2 > 2000;
```

---

## ✅ 5. **Update Using Subquery**

### 🔹 Example: Set population of smallest island to 999

```sql
UPDATE island
SET population = 999
WHERE area_km2 = (SELECT MIN(area_km2) FROM island);
```

---

## ✅ 6. **Using LIMIT (in MySQL)**

```sql
UPDATE island
SET population = 8888
ORDER BY population ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

📌 This updates just 1 row — the one with the **smallest population**.

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

| Tip                         | Why                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Always use `WHERE`          | Prevents accidental updates to all rows    |
| Backup before major updates | To recover if something goes wrong         |
| Test with `SELECT` first    | Run a `SELECT` with your `WHERE` to verify |

---

## ❌ Common Mistakes

### ❗ Forgets WHERE:

```sql
UPDATE island SET population = 0;  -- updates **all rows**!
```

### ❗ Wrong column name:

```sql
UPDATE island SET populations = 1000;  -- error: wrong column
```
Awesome — let’s move on to **`DELETE`**, the SQL command used to **remove rows** from a table.

---








## 🔥 What is `DELETE` in SQL?

`DELETE` permanently removes **one or more rows** from a table.

---

## 🔤 Basic Syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

⚠️ **No `WHERE` = deletes all rows!**

---

## 🏝️ Using Your `island` Table

Let’s say your table still looks like this:

```sql
-- id | name       | country      | area_km2 | population
-- 1  | Bora Bora  | France       | 30.55    | 10500
-- 2  | Bali       | Indonesia    | 5980.00  | 4230050
-- 3  | Maui       | Unknown      | 1883.50  | 144444
-- 4  | Jeju       | South Korea  | 1848.00  | 700000
-- 5  | Sicily     | Italy        | 25711.00 | 4500000
```

---

## ✅ 1. **Delete a Specific Row**

### 🔹 Delete Maui

```sql
DELETE FROM island
WHERE name = 'Maui';
```

---

## ✅ 2. **Delete Multiple Rows**

### 🔹 Delete all islands in `France` or `Italy`

```sql
DELETE FROM island
WHERE country IN ('France', 'Italy');
```

---

## ✅ 3. **Delete Using Numeric Condition**

### 🔹 Delete islands smaller than 1000 km²

```sql
DELETE FROM island
WHERE area_km2 < 1000;
```

---

## ✅ 4. **Delete All Rows** (Be Careful!)

```sql
DELETE FROM island;
```

💣 Removes **everything** but keeps the table structure.

---

## ✅ 5. **Delete with LIMIT** (MySQL only)

```sql
DELETE FROM island
ORDER BY population ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

🧼 Deletes the **least populated** island.

---

## ✅ 6. **Delete with Subquery**

### 🔹 Delete island with **max area**

```sql
DELETE FROM island
WHERE area_km2 = (SELECT MAX(area_km2) FROM island);
```

---

## 🛑 DELETE vs DROP vs TRUNCATE

| Command    | What it does              | Keeps table? | Rollbackable?            |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| `DELETE`   | Removes rows (with WHERE) | ✅ Yes        | ✅ Yes (with transaction) |
| `DROP`     | Deletes entire table      | ❌ No         | ❌ No                     |
| `TRUNCATE` | Deletes all rows fast     | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No (in most systems)   |

---

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **ALWAYS use `WHERE` unless you mean to delete all rows**.
2. Use `SELECT` first to preview what you're deleting.
3. Wrap in a **transaction** if needed:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
DELETE FROM island WHERE name = 'Bali';
ROLLBACK;  -- or COMMIT;
```







## 🔗 What is a `JOIN`?

A **JOIN** lets you **combine rows from two or more tables** based on a related column between them — usually a **foreign key**.

---

## 🏗️ Example Tables

Let’s say you have these two tables:

### 1. `island`

```sql
-- id | name       | country      | area_km2
-- 1  | Bali       | Indonesia    | 5780.00
-- 2  | Maui       | USA          | 1883.50
-- 3  | Sicily     | Italy        | 25711.00
```

### 2. `island_info`

```sql
-- id | island_id | population | famous_for
-- 1  | 1         | 4230050    | Tourism
-- 2  | 2         | 144444     | Volcanoes
-- 3  | 3         | 5000000    | Culture
```

> 🧠 `island_info.island_id` is a **foreign key** linking to `island.id`.

---

## ✅ 1. **INNER JOIN**

Only returns rows with matching values in **both tables**.

```sql
SELECT island.name, island_info.population, island_info.famous_for
FROM island
INNER JOIN island_info
  ON island.id = island_info.island_id;
```

**🔎 Result:**

| name   | population | famous\_for |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| Bali   | 4230050    | Tourism     |
| Maui   | 144444     | Volcanoes   |
| Sicily | 5000000    | Culture     |

---

## ✅ 2. **LEFT JOIN**

Returns **all rows from the left table** (`island`), and matched rows from the right (`island_info`), or `NULL` if no match.

```sql
SELECT island.name, island_info.population
FROM island
LEFT JOIN island_info
  ON island.id = island_info.island_id;
```

> Useful to **keep all islands**, even if info is missing.

---

## ✅ 3. **RIGHT JOIN**

Returns **all rows from the right table**, and matched rows from the left.

```sql
SELECT island_info.famous_for, island.name
FROM island_info
RIGHT JOIN island
  ON island.id = island_info.island_id;
```

> Not supported in all databases (like SQLite), but common in MySQL/PostgreSQL.

---

## ✅ 4. **FULL OUTER JOIN**

Returns all records when there's a match in **either table**.

```sql
SELECT island.name, island_info.population
FROM island
FULL OUTER JOIN island_info
  ON island.id = island_info.island_id;
```

> ✅ Requires a DB that supports full outer joins (like PostgreSQL).

---

## ✅ 5. **CROSS JOIN**

Returns **every combination** of rows from both tables.

```sql
SELECT island.name, island_info.famous_for
FROM island
CROSS JOIN island_info;
```

> ⚠️ Be careful — the result can grow **very large**!

---

## 🔐 Real-Life Use Case

Imagine you have:

* A `customers` table
* An `orders` table with a `customer_id`

You can join them:

```sql
SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
```

---

## 🧠 JOIN Types Summary

| Type    | Returns...                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `INNER` | Only matched rows in both tables      |
| `LEFT`  | All from left + matched from right    |
| `RIGHT` | All from right + matched from left    |
| `FULL`  | All rows from both (if supported)     |
| `CROSS` | Every combination (Cartesian product) |

---





Awesome! Let’s learn about **Aggregate Functions** and **`GROUP BY`**, which let you **summarize data** in powerful ways.

---

## 📊 What Are Aggregate Functions?

Aggregate functions perform **calculations** on a **group of rows**, returning **a single value**.

### 🔹 Common Aggregate Functions:

| Function  | What it does            |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| `COUNT()` | Counts rows             |
| `SUM()`   | Adds up numeric values  |
| `AVG()`   | Calculates average      |
| `MAX()`   | Gets the largest value  |
| `MIN()`   | Gets the smallest value |

---

## 🧠 What is `GROUP BY`?

`GROUP BY` groups rows **with the same value** in specified columns so you can apply aggregate functions **per group**.

---

## 🏝️ Example: island Table

Let’s say we have this data:

| id | name   | country   | area\_km2 | population |
| -- | ------ | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 1  | Bali   | Indonesia | 5780.00   | 4230050    |
| 2  | Lombok | Indonesia | 4514.00   | 3160000    |
| 3  | Maui   | USA       | 1883.50   | 144444     |
| 4  | Oahu   | USA       | 1545.00   | 953207     |

## ✅ 1. `COUNT()` — How many islands per country?

```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS island_count
FROM island
GROUP BY country;
```

**Result:**

| country   | island\_count |
| --------- | ------------- |
| Indonesia | 2             |
| USA       | 2             |
| Italy     | 1             |

---

## ✅ 2. `SUM()` — Total population per country

```sql
SELECT country, SUM(population) AS total_population
FROM island
GROUP BY country;
```

---

## ✅ 3. `AVG()` — Average island size per country

```sql
SELECT country, AVG(area_km2) AS avg_area
FROM island
GROUP BY country;
```

---

## ✅ 4. `MAX()` and `MIN()` — Largest and smallest islands per country

```sql
SELECT country, MAX(area_km2) AS largest_island, MIN(area_km2) AS smallest_island
FROM island
GROUP BY country;
```

---

## ✅ 5. `GROUP BY` with `ORDER BY`

```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS island_count
FROM island
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY island_count DESC;
```

---

## ✅ 6. Filtering with `HAVING` (After `GROUP BY`)

```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS island_count
FROM island
GROUP BY country
HAVING island_count > 1;
```

> `HAVING` is like `WHERE`, but **used with aggregates**.

---

## ✅ 7. Without GROUP BY — Aggregate all rows

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_islands, SUM(population) AS total_population
FROM island;
```

---

## Summary:

| Clause     | Used For                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| `GROUP BY` | Grouping rows by a column |
| `HAVING`   | Filtering groups          |
| `ORDER BY` | Sorting result            |
| `WHERE`    | Filtering individual rows |

Great! Let’s dive into **🧠 Subqueries** — one of the most powerful features in SQL.

---

## 🔍 What is a Subquery?

A **subquery** (or nested query) is a `SELECT` statement **inside another SQL statement**.

Subqueries can be used in:

* `SELECT`
* `FROM`
* `WHERE`
* `HAVING`

---

## 🏝 Example Table: `island`

| id | name   | country   | area\_km2 | population |
| -- | ------ | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 1  | Bali   | Indonesia | 5780      | 4230050    |
| 2  | Lombok | Indonesia | 4514      | 3160000    |
| 3  | Maui   | USA       | 1883.5    | 144444     |
| 4  | Oahu   | USA       | 1545      | 953207     |
| 5  | Sicily | Italy     | 25711     | 5000000    |

---

## ✅ 1. Subquery in `WHERE` Clause

Get islands with **above-average population**:

```sql
SELECT name, population
FROM island
WHERE population > (
  SELECT AVG(population) FROM island
);
```

---

## ✅ 2. Subquery in `SELECT` Clause

Show island + country + average area of **all islands**:

```sql
SELECT name, country,
  (SELECT AVG(area_km2) FROM island) AS avg_area_all
FROM island;
```

---

## ✅ 3. Subquery in `FROM` Clause

Use subquery as a temporary table:

```sql
SELECT country, island_count
FROM (
  SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS island_count
  FROM island
  GROUP BY country
) AS sub;
```

---

## ✅ 4. Subquery with `IN`

Get islands in the **same countries** as those with more than 2 islands:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM island
WHERE country IN (
  SELECT country
  FROM island
  GROUP BY country
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);
```

---

## ✅ 5. Subquery with `EXISTS`

Check if a country has **any island with area > 10,000**:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM island i
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM island sub
  WHERE sub.country = i.country AND sub.area_km2 > 10000
);
```

---

## ✅ 6. Correlated Subquery

Compare each island to the **average population of its own country**:

```sql
SELECT name, population, country
FROM island i1
WHERE population > (
  SELECT AVG(population)
  FROM island i2
  WHERE i2.country = i1.country
);
```

> ⚠️ Correlated subqueries refer to the **outer query’s row**, so they are **re-evaluated for each row**.

---

## 💡 Subquery Tips

| Use Case            | Best Option         |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Return single value | Scalar subquery     |
| Use in WHERE/IN     | Subquery in WHERE   |
| Build virtual table | Subquery in FROM    |
| Compare each row    | Correlated subquery |

Awesome! 🎯 Let's level up with **Advanced `SELECT` Filtering** — techniques to filter rows precisely using SQL.

---

## 🔍 1. `BETWEEN` – Filter a Range of Values

```sql
SELECT name, area_km2
FROM island
WHERE area_km2 BETWEEN 1000 AND 6000;
```

> ✅ Includes both 1000 **and** 6000

---

## 🔍 2. `IN` – Match Against Multiple Values

```sql
SELECT name, country
FROM island
WHERE country IN ('Indonesia', 'Italy');
```

> 🔁 Same as using multiple `OR` conditions

---

## 🔍 3. `LIKE` – Pattern Matching

```sql
SELECT name
FROM island
WHERE name LIKE 'M%';  -- Starts with M
```

### Patterns:

| Pattern   | Matches                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `'A%'`    | Starts with A                  |
| `'%land'` | Ends with 'land'               |
| `'%i%'`   | Contains 'i'                   |
| `'M___'`  | Starts with 'M' + 3 characters |

---

## 🔍 4. `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL`

```sql
SELECT name
FROM island
WHERE population IS NULL;
```

> Use this to find **missing** or **empty values**

---

## 🔍 5. Logical Operators: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`

```sql
SELECT name
FROM island
WHERE area_km2 > 1000 AND country = 'USA';
```

```sql
SELECT name
FROM island
WHERE NOT country = 'Italy';
```

---

## 🔍 6. `CASE` for Conditional Filtering in Results

```sql
SELECT name, country,
  CASE
    WHEN population > 1000000 THEN 'Large'
    WHEN population > 500000 THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'Small'
  END AS population_group
FROM island;
```

---

## 🔍 7. Combine with `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `DISTINCT`

```sql
-- Top 3 largest islands
SELECT name, area_km2
FROM island
ORDER BY area_km2 DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

```sql
-- Unique countries
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM island;
```

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Filter with Subquery

```sql
SELECT name
FROM island
WHERE area_km2 > (
  SELECT AVG(area_km2) FROM island
);
```

---

## 🔄 Summary Table

| Clause       | Use Case                     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `BETWEEN`    | Filter in range              |
| `IN`         | Match any from a list        |
| `LIKE`       | Match patterns in text       |
| `IS NULL`    | Filter missing values        |
| `AND/OR/NOT` | Combine conditions logically |
| `CASE`       | Conditional expressions      |
| `LIMIT`      | Limit number of results      |

Perfect! 🧱 Let’s learn about **Table Design & Relationships** — the foundation of a good database structure.

---

## 🧩 1. Why Table Design Matters

Designing tables well ensures:

* ✅ Organized, reliable data
* ✅ Efficient queries
* ✅ Easy maintenance
* ✅ Enforced data rules (integrity)

---

## 🧱 2. Table Components

Each SQL table has:

| Part            | Description                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Columns**     | The data fields (name, age, etc.)               |
| **Data Types**  | Type for each column (INT, VARCHAR, DATE, etc.) |
| **Constraints** | Rules like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, etc.               |
| **Keys**        | Primary and foreign keys                        |

---

## 🔐 3. Common Constraints

| Constraint    | Meaning                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `PRIMARY KEY` | Uniquely identifies a row            |
| `FOREIGN KEY` | Links to another table’s primary key |
| `NOT NULL`    | Field must have a value              |
| `UNIQUE`      | No duplicate values allowed          |
| `DEFAULT`     | Value to use if none provided        |
| `CHECK`       | Must meet a specific condition       |

---

## 🗂 4. Primary Keys

* Each table **must have a primary key**
* Can be one column or multiple (composite key)

```sql
CREATE TABLE country (
    code CHAR(2) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

---

## 🔗 5. Foreign Keys – Table Relationships

* A foreign key in one table **references a primary key in another**
* Used to **connect data** between tables

### One-to-Many Relationship

```sql
CREATE TABLE island (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    country_code CHAR(2),
    FOREIGN KEY (country_code) REFERENCES country(code)
);
```

Here, many islands can belong to one country.

---

## 📚 6. Types of Relationships

| Type         | Description                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| One-to-One   | One record per side                        |
| One-to-Many  | One row in Table A maps to many in Table B |
| Many-to-Many | Needs a third (join) table                 |

### Many-to-Many Example

```sql
-- Students and Courses
CREATE TABLE student_course (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES student(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES course(id)
);
```

---

## 🎯 7. Naming Conventions (Best Practice)

| Element    | Example          |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Table name | `students`       |
| PK column  | `id`             |
| FK column  | `student_id`     |
| Join table | `student_course` |

---

## ✅ Example: Full Setup

```sql
CREATE TABLE country (
    code CHAR(2) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE island (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    area_km2 DECIMAL(10,2),
    population INT,
    country_code CHAR(2),
    FOREIGN KEY (country_code) REFERENCES country(code)
);
```

---

## 🧠 Summary

* **Primary Key** = Unique row ID
* **Foreign Key** = Connects tables
* **Constraints** = Enforce rules
* **Relationships** = Link data across tables

Awesome! 🧪 Let’s explore **Transactions and Rollbacks** — critical for ensuring safe and reliable database operations.

---

## 💡 What is a Transaction?

A **transaction** is a group of one or more SQL operations that are **executed as a single unit**.
If **any part fails**, the **whole transaction can be rolled back**.

Think of it like:

> 💳 “Transfer money from Account A ➡️ to Account B — but only if both operations succeed.”

---

## 🔐 Transaction Properties (ACID)

| Property            | Meaning                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **A** – Atomicity   | All operations succeed or none do            |
| **C** – Consistency | Keeps database in a valid state              |
| **I** – Isolation   | Transactions don’t interfere with each other |
| **D** – Durability  | Once committed, data changes are permanent   |

---

## 🔧 1. Basic Transaction Syntax

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT;
```

> ✅ All changes are saved only when `COMMIT` is executed.

---

## 🧯 2. ROLLBACK – Undo a Transaction

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
-- Oops! Something’s wrong
ROLLBACK;
```

> 🔄 No changes are saved. Everything is undone.

---

## ✅ 3. COMMIT – Finalize the Transaction

```sql
COMMIT;
```

After this, the changes are **permanently saved** to the database.

---

## ⚠️ 4. Real-World Example

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO orders (user_id, total) VALUES (5, 199.99);
UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE product_id = 10;

-- Something fails: stock is already 0
ROLLBACK;
```

> Without `ROLLBACK`, the order would be placed even if stock is unavailable!

---

## 🧠 5. Savepoints (Optional/Advanced)

You can mark points in a transaction to **partially roll back**.

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

SAVEPOINT step1;
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Alice');

SAVEPOINT step2;
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Bob');

ROLLBACK TO step1; -- Undoes Bob, keeps Alice

COMMIT;
```

---

## 🚀 Summary

| Keyword             | Description                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `START TRANSACTION` | Begin a new transaction                       |
| `COMMIT`            | Save all changes made in the transaction      |
| `ROLLBACK`          | Undo all changes since `START`                |
| `SAVEPOINT`         | Create a rollback marker inside a transaction |
| `ROLLBACK TO`       | Roll back to a specific savepoint             |

Great choice! 📂 **Views** and **Stored Procedures** are powerful tools that help organize, simplify, and reuse SQL logic. Let’s explore both.

---

## 📄 1. **Views** — Virtual Tables

A **View** is a saved SQL query. It acts like a table but **doesn’t store data**, only the logic.

### ✅ Why Use Views?

* Simplify complex queries
* Improve security (hide sensitive columns)
* Reuse query logic

### 🛠 Create a View

```sql
CREATE VIEW large_islands AS
SELECT name, area_km2, country
FROM island
WHERE area_km2 > 10000;
```

### 📊 Use the View Like a Table

```sql
SELECT * FROM large_islands;
```

### 🧽 Update or Drop the View

```sql
DROP VIEW large_islands;
```

> ⚠️ Not all views are editable (depends on the query inside).

---

## ⚙️ 2. **Stored Procedures** — Reusable SQL Blocks

A **Stored Procedure** is a block of SQL statements saved in the database that you can **call by name**.

### ✅ Why Use Stored Procedures?

* Reuse SQL logic
* Accept parameters
* Simplify business logic
* Improve performance (in some cases)

---

### 📥 Create a Procedure

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE GetIslandsByCountry(IN country_name VARCHAR(100))
BEGIN
    SELECT name, area_km2
    FROM island
    WHERE country = country_name;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

---

### ▶️ Call the Procedure

```sql
CALL GetIslandsByCountry('Indonesia');
```

---

### 🧽 Drop the Procedure

```sql
DROP PROCEDURE GetIslandsByCountry;
```

---

## 🔍 Comparison Table

| Feature            | View                | Stored Procedure      |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Acts Like a Table  | ✅                   | ❌                     |
| Stores Data        | ❌ (just logic)      | ❌ (logic only)        |
| Accepts Parameters | ❌                   | ✅                     |
| Useful For         | Simplifying queries | Reusable operations   |
| Supports Logic     | No                  | Yes (e.g., IF, loops) |

---

## 🎯 Summary

* Use **Views** to simplify complex `SELECT` queries
* Use **Stored Procedures** for reusable, parameterized SQL logic

---









Great! 🔄 Let’s dive into **Indexes** — the secret behind fast SQL queries.

---

## 🚀 What Is an Index?

An **index** in SQL is like an index in a book — it helps you **find rows faster** without scanning the entire table.

### Without an Index:

> SQL scans the whole table (slow if millions of rows)

### With an Index:

> SQL jumps directly to matching rows (much faster!)

---

## 📚 Basic Index Syntax

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name(column_name);
```

### Example:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_country_code ON island(country_code);
```

Now, queries like this become faster:

```sql
SELECT * FROM island WHERE country_code = 'JP';
```

---

## 💡 When to Use Indexes

| Use Index If...                              |
| -------------------------------------------- |
| You **search/filter** on the column (WHERE)  |
| You **JOIN** on that column                  |
| You **ORDER BY** or **GROUP BY** that column |
| The table has **lots of rows**               |

---

## ⚠️ Indexes Are Not Free

| Downside                       | Why it matters                      |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 🐢 Slower INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE | Indexes must also be updated        |
| 💽 Uses extra disk space       | Especially with many or big indexes |
| ❌ Too many indexes = confusion | Can actually slow down performance  |

---

## 🧠 Types of Indexes

| Index Type        | Description                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `PRIMARY KEY`     | Automatically indexed                         |
| `UNIQUE`          | Prevents duplicates, also indexed             |
| `SINGLE COLUMN`   | Most common, fast for one-column searches     |
| `COMPOSITE INDEX` | Multi-column index (e.g. `INDEX(col1, col2)`) |
| `FULLTEXT`        | For text searching (MySQL specific)           |
| `SPATIAL`         | For geolocation queries (MySQL/PostGIS)       |

---

## 🔍 Composite Index Example

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_island_country_area ON island(country_code, area_km2);
```

This helps queries like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM island
WHERE country_code = 'ID' AND area_km2 > 1000;
```

> Tip: SQL only uses left-most columns of a composite index efficiently.

---

## 🔧 Managing Indexes

| Task          | Command                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| View indexes  | `SHOW INDEX FROM table_name;`          |
| Drop an index | `DROP INDEX index_name ON table_name;` |
| Rename index  | (Not all databases support directly)   |

---

## 🧠 Example: Indexed vs Non-Indexed

```sql
-- No index
SELECT * FROM island WHERE name = 'Java';

-- Add index
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON island(name);

-- Now it's fast!
```

---

## 🧪 Summary

✅ Index = fast lookup
✅ Use on WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY
⚠️ Don’t overuse (hurts performance + space)
🛠 Use `SHOW INDEX` to review what's active

---







Excellent choice! 🔒 **User Permissions & Security** are essential for protecting your data and controlling access in a multi-user environment.

---

## 🔐 Why It Matters

Without proper security:

* Anyone could delete or modify critical data 😱
* Sensitive info (e.g., emails, passwords) could be leaked
* One careless user = big data loss

---

## 👤 SQL Users and Privileges

In most SQL systems (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), **users** are separate from tables and must be given **permissions**.

---

### 🧱 1. Creating a New User

```sql
-- Syntax may vary slightly by DBMS
CREATE USER 'student'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_password';
```

---

### ✅ 2. Granting Permissions

```sql
-- Grant read-only access
GRANT SELECT ON school.* TO 'student'@'localhost';

-- Grant full access to a specific table
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON school.students TO 'student'@'localhost';
```

---

### ⛔ 3. Revoking Permissions

```sql
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE ON school.students FROM 'student'@'localhost';
```

---

### 🔍 4. Check Permissions

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'student'@'localhost';
```

## 🔐 Common Privileges

| Privilege      | What it allows                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `SELECT`       | Read data                                |
| `INSERT`       | Add data                                 |
| `UPDATE`       | Modify data                              |
| `DELETE`       | Remove data                              |
| `ALL`          | All privileges                           |
| `CREATE`       | Create tables, databases                 |
| `DROP`         | Drop tables, databases                   |
| `GRANT OPTION` | Let user give their privileges to others |

---

### 📦 Example Use Case

```sql
-- Create user for reporting only
CREATE USER 'reporter'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'r3port123';

-- Give only SELECT access to everything in the company database
GRANT SELECT ON company.* TO 'reporter'@'%';
```

This user **cannot** modify or delete any data — perfect for dashboards and analytics.

---

## 🚨 Security Tips

✅ Use **strong passwords**
✅ Limit users to **only what they need**
✅ Avoid using the `root` user for apps
✅ Regularly **audit permissions**

---

## 🛑 Danger: Don't Do This

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'webuser'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

This gives full, unrestricted access to everything! ❌

Perfect! 🗃️ **Normalization & Schema Design** are fundamental for creating efficient, reliable, and scalable databases. Let’s break it down.

---

## 🧱 What is Normalization?

**Normalization** is the process of organizing your database tables and relationships to:

* Reduce **data redundancy** (duplicate data)
* Improve **data integrity** (consistency & accuracy)
* Make updates, inserts, and deletes easier and less error-prone

---

## 📊 Normal Forms (NF) — Levels of Normalization

### 1️⃣ First Normal Form (1NF)

* Each column contains **atomic (indivisible)** values
* Each row is **unique**
* No repeating groups or arrays

**Example problem:**
A table with a column holding multiple phone numbers in one cell violates 1NF.

---

### 2️⃣ Second Normal Form (2NF)

* Meets **1NF**
* All **non-key columns** depend on the **whole primary key** (not just part of it)
* Applies mainly when primary key is composite (multiple columns)

---

### 3️⃣ Third Normal Form (3NF)

* Meets **2NF**
* No transitive dependencies: Non-key columns depend **only** on the primary key, not other non-key columns

---

## 🤔 Why Normalize?

| Benefit                | Explanation                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Avoid Data Duplication | Less storage, less inconsistency    |
| Easier Updates         | Change data in one place, not many  |
| Better Data Integrity  | Relationships enforced through keys |
| Simplifies Maintenance | Clearer, organized schema           |

---

## 🧩 Example: Normalize a Simple Table

### Unnormalized Table: `orders`

| order\_id | customer\_name | customer\_phone | product  | quantity |
| --------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1         | Alice          | 123-456-7890    | Keyboard | 2        |
| 2         | Alice          | 123-456-7890    | Mouse    | 1        |
| 3         | Bob            | 987-654-3210    | Monitor  | 1        |

**Issues:**

* Customer info repeated for each order
* Hard to update customer phone without changing multiple rows

---

### Normalize into 3 Tables:

**Customers**

| customer\_id | customer\_name | customer\_phone |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| 1            | Alice          | 123-456-7890    |
| 2            | Bob            | 987-654-3210    |

**Products**

| product\_id | product  |
| ----------- | -------- |
| 1           | Keyboard |
| 2           | Mouse    |
| 3           | Monitor  |

**Orders**

| order\_id | customer\_id | product\_id | quantity |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| 1         | 1            | 1           | 2        |
| 2         | 1            | 2           | 1        |
| 3         | 2            | 3           | 1        |

---

## 🛠 Schema Design Tips

* Use **primary keys** for uniqueness (usually auto-increment IDs)
* Define **foreign keys** to link related tables
* Choose appropriate **data types** for each column
* Avoid **nulls** where possible by using defaults or proper constraints
* Document your design for clarity

## 🧠 Quick Recap

| Normal Form | What it Fixes                       | Key Idea                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1NF         | Atomic values, no repeating groups  | Make each cell indivisible        |
| 2NF         | No partial dependency on part of PK | Full PK dependency                |
| 3NF         | No transitive dependency            | Non-key columns depend only on PK |

Great choice! 📦 **Backup & Restore** are crucial skills for protecting your data from loss or corruption. Let's dive into the essentials.

---

## 💾 What is Backup & Restore?

* **Backup**: A copy of your database data, saved safely elsewhere
* **Restore**: Using a backup to recover your database to a previous state

---

## 🔑 Why Backups Matter

* Protect against accidental deletion or data corruption
* Recover from hardware failure or software bugs
* Keep data safe during upgrades or migrations

---

## 🛠 Backup Methods

### 1. Logical Backup (SQL Dump)

* Exports database schema + data as SQL commands
* Portable across different database versions and systems
* Example (MySQL):

```bash
mysqldump -u username -p database_name > backup.sql
```

---

### 2. Physical Backup

* Copies raw database files at the filesystem level
* Faster for large databases but less portable
* Requires the database to be offline or in a consistent state

---

## 🧰 Restore Methods

### 1. Restore from SQL Dump

```bash
mysql -u username -p database_name < backup.sql
```

* Recreates tables and inserts data from the dump file

---

### 2. Restore from Physical Backup

* Depends on your database system; usually involves copying files back and restarting the server

---

## 🗓 Backup Best Practices

* Schedule **regular automated backups** (daily, weekly)
* Store backups **offsite or in the cloud**
* Test your backups periodically by restoring to a test server
* Keep multiple backup versions (last week, month, year)
* Secure backups with encryption and access controls

---

## 🔄 Example Workflow (MySQL)

1. Backup database:

```bash
mysqldump -u root -p mydatabase > mydatabase_backup_2025_06_07.sql
```

2. Restore database:

```bash
mysql -u root -p mydatabase < mydatabase_backup_2025_06_07.sql
```

---

## ⚠️ Things to Remember

* Always backup **before** making major changes
* Verify your backups are complete and uncorrupted
* Backups don’t replace good database design or security
